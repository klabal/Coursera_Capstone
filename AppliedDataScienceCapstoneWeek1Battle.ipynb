However, some things can be considered as guidelines for attractiveness towards tourists - restaurants, cafes, entertainment places like museums, theaters, pubs/bars, art galleries, hotels, stadiums, arenas. But how does one (given a positive financial and pandemic situation) decide between the two cities for a short visit? The essence of the project is to give a clear answer to the aforementioned question with the data about the key parameters (entertainment venues, restaurants, hotels, cafes). The aim of the project is to 1) use k-means clustering approach to building the model of clusters, 2) to utilize Foursquare API in getting venue data for the analysis."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 2.
